# MRIReco.jl

*Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reconstruction*

## Introduction

MRIReco.jl is a Julia package for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The Library
provides a simulation and reconstruction framework where common and specific
problems can be formulated and solved by direct or iterative
optimization algorithms.

## Installation

Start julia and open the package mode by entering `]`. The enter
```julia
add https://github.com/tknopp/LinearSolver.jl
add https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRIReco.jl
```
This will install the packages `LinearSolver.jl`, `MRIReco.jl`

## Usage

  * See [Getting Started](@ref) for an introduction to using the package
